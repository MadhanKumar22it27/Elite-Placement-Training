static Keyword:
    it has static variable and static method.

    static variable:
        how to use - use it before the variable name.
        if it is used and change the value for variable, then it affects the all objects

    static method:
        it is used to call the function without creating object

Four Pillars of OOPS:
    Abstraction
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance
    Encapsulation

Polymorphism:
    it means many forms.
    same method is used for different purposes.
    Based on that, it has two types:

        Method Overriding:
            Redefine the method which is already mentioned.
            it is used in inheritance for extend the base class to the derived class.

        Method Overloading:
            different methods with same names acting based on the number of parameters.
            it is not possible in python.
             if you still want to do this, then use the *args .
