Four pillars of OOPS
    Polymorphism
    Inheritance
    Abstraction
    Encapsulation

Inheritance
    inherit the parent's behaviour to the child's class.

    types of inheritance:
        single
        multiple
        multi-level
        hybrid
        hierarical

    it is used by the keyword called "extends".

    1.single-level:
        one child inherit the one parent class

    2.multi-level:
        grandparent's property inherit by parent and that parent's property inherit by the child.

    3.Hierarical:
        multiple children inherit the single parent's property.

    4.multiple:
        two or more parent's property inherit by single child.

    5.Hybird:
        Combination of two or more types of inheritance.

    super keyword:
        it is used in three ways:
            super variable
            super method
            super constructor

        purpose:
            if you want to access the parent's property in child's class while both have same name, then use the super keyword.
