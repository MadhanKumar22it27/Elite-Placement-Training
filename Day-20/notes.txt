Four Pillars
    1. Inheritance
    2. Polymorphism
    3. Abstraction
    4. Encapsulation

Abstraction:
    If you want to define abstract method, it should be inside the abstract class.
    Abstract method should be declare only, not define.
    you can't create an object, but create a reference(inheritance)
    Abstract method should be override.

    Interface
        It is similar to class.
        Interface is abstract static type only and can't change.
        with help of this, We can achieve the multiple inheritance.
        Instead of using extends, we should use the implements keyword.
