If you want to use the consant value, so use the keyword "final"

Data Types:
    1) Primitive - int, float(accept 6 decimal), long, double(accept 14 decimal), char, short, byte, and boolean (in-built)
    2) Non-Primitive - String, Arrays, and Classes (dervied except String). it starts from the captial letters

    primitive:
        byte - 1 byte - stores -128 to 127
        short - 2 bytes - stores -32,768 to 32,767
        int - 4 bytes - stores  -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
        long - 8 bytes - stores -9,223,372,036,854 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
        float - 4 bytes - stores more than enough to 6 to 7 decimal
        double - 8 bytes - stores more than enough to 15 decimal
        boolean - 1 built - stores more than enough to true or false
        char - 2 bytes - stores more than enough to single character

        Scientific Numbers:
            A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10
    Non-Primitive:
        character - single quotes
        String - double quotes

        System.out.print - it prints in single line
        System.out.println - it prints in next line

    Difference
        primitive has always a value, while non-primitive has a null

Type Casting:
    it converts one datatype into another datatype

    it has two types, they are
        1)Widening Casting
        2)Narrowing Casting

    1) Widening Casting:
        converting the smaller to a larger size type. it occurs automatically
        byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

    2) Narrowing Casting:
        converting the larger to a smaller size type. it occurs manually
        double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
