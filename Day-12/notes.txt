Functions:
    Two types of functions, they are,
        1. User-Defined

        with parameters and without return types
        without parameters and with return types
        without parameters and without return types

    parameters are passed by two ways, they are
        pass by value(for primitive data types)
        pass by reference(for non-primitive data types)

    Recursion:
        A function calling itself eg: factorial
