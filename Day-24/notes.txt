Exception Handling
    There are two types of errors
        1. Runtime errors.
        2. Compile time errors.

        Runtime errors occurs during the execution, while compile time errors occurs during the run or compile the code.

    We can handle the errors using the try-catch block

    try:
        run the error expected code in the try.
    catch:
        if error throws, it catches and print the exception as simple output.
    finally:
        if you want to run the particular code even it's a error, finally run the partivluarocde
